### Description

Long time listener, first time caller. I believe computers should have more lights and make noise like they do in the movies. This program helps correct some of these flaws. The Idea is from an old movie probably everyone here has seen. When it gets all twelve it launches the missiles. Some useful coding examples include: Play a Wav by API, API drag around, Resource file plus more&#8230; Various pieces parts from PSC, thanks if it looks like yours. I wrote it a while ago so I forgot where I got things. Enjoy all.
